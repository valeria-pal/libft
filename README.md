# libft
<<<<<<< HEAD
A Custom Standard C Library
Features
ğŸ“š Reimplemented Standard Functions
libft recreates many essential functions from the standard C libraries <string.h>, <stdlib.h>, and <ctype.h>. Some examples include:

Memory Handling

ft_memset â€“ Fill a block of memory with a specific value.
ft_memcpy â€“ Copy a block of memory.
ft_memmove â€“ Move memory safely to handle overlapping blocks.
ft_memcmp â€“ Compare blocks of memory.

String Manipulation

ft_strlen â€“ Calculate the length of a string.
ft_strncmp â€“ Compare two strings up to a certain number of characters.
ft_strcpy / ft_strncpy â€“ Copy strings safely.
ft_strdup â€“ Duplicate a string, allocating the necessary memory.
Character Utilities

ft_isalpha, ft_isdigit, ft_isalnum â€“ Check character types.
ft_tolower, ft_toupper â€“ Convert character cases.

âœ¨ Custom Utility Functions
In addition to standard functions, libft includes custom utilities designed to enhance development productivity:

String Utilities

ft_itoa â€“ Convert an integer into a string.
ft_split â€“ Split a string into an array of substrings based on a delimiter.
ft_strjoin â€“ Join two strings into a newly allocated string.
ft_substr â€“ Extract a substring from a string.
ft_strtrim â€“ Trim unwanted characters from the beginning and end of a string.

Numerical Conversions

ft_atoi â€“ Convert a string to an integer.
